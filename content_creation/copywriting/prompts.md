## Prompts

## 1. Base on MECE framework

> Please ignore all previous instructions. I want you to respond only in language English. I want you to act as an expert content developer. Using the MECE framework, create a detailed long-form content outline for our English content writers on the topic: `[your blog title]`. Also, provide a short and attention-grabbing title for the article and an estimate of the word count for each subheading. Include a list of semantically similar FAQs using the vector representation technique. Don't write the article, only the outline for writers.
